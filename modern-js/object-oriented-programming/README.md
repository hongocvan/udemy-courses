# Four Fundamental OPP Principles

**Abstraction**: Ignoring or hiding details that **don't matter**, allowing us to get an **overview** perspective of the thing we're implementing, instead of messing with details that don't really matter to our implementation.

**Encapsulation**: Keeping properties and methods **private** inside the class, so they are **not accessible from outside the class**. Some methods can be **exposed** as a public interface (API).

**Inheritance**: Making all properties and methods of a certain class **available to a child class**, forming a hierarchical relationshop between classes. This allows us to **reuse common login** and to model real-world relationships.

**Polymorphism**: A child class can **overwrite** a method it inherited from a parent class [it's more complex that that, but enough for our purposes.]
