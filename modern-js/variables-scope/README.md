# Global Scope

-   Outside of **any** function or block
-   Variables declared in global scope are accessible **everywhere**

# Function Scope

-   Variables are accessible only **inside function, NOT** outside
-   Also called local scope

# Block Scope (ES6)

-   Variables are accessible only **inside block** (block scoped)
-   **HOWEVER**, this only applies to **let** and **const** variables
-   Functions are **also block scoped** (only in strict mode)
