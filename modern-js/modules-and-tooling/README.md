# Functional programming

**Side effect**: Modification (mutation) of any data **outside** of the function (mutating external variables, logging to console, writing to DOM, etc.)

**Pure function**: Function without side effects. Does not depend on external variables. **Given the same inputs, always returns the same outputs**

**Immutability**: State (data) is **never** modified! Instead, state is **copied** and the copy is mutated and returned.
